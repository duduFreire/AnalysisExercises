# AnalysisExercises
My attempts at solutions to some real analysis exercises.

Exercises 1.3.2 up to 1.4.11 of Abbott's book are all from the first edition of Understanding Analysis, all others belong to the second edition.

While trying to learn some real analysis on my own, I found that writing down the answers to every exercise can help the learning process a lot, 
so I took the opportunity to also start learning LaTeX. It is very likely that there are some mistakes among the solutions posted here, as this is my
first time trying out a proof-based math course.
